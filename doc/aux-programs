cte comes with a bunch of auxiliary programs which help visualizing and show
how to use the files output by cte.  As a rule, any of these called without
arguments exhibit a message explaining the call.

simula - given a jobname and a champion tree number, generates a file of a
       	 given size simulating the tree process

dotree
showtrees - both are given a jobname an an interval of champion trees to show.
	    Both produce pdf file, shown through adobe reader.  dotree uses
	    dot, from the graphwiz package; showtrees uses LaTeX, with the
	    qtree package.  qtree can only handles alphabets of size up to 5,
	    dotree has no limitation (except for visual).

seltree - tries to select a tree by the SMC criterion, using the Wilcoxon test
	  to detect the inflexion point on log-loss.

Data file generation:

perturb
shufunif - simple program that perturb a data file, used to check the
	   stability of the algorithm

genpars - generates a stationary, non-ergodic process.  cte goes crazy.
