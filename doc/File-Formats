champ
  Contains on each line a champion tree, in order of increased penalty.
  Each line has the format:
  # num [ tree ]
  where num is a (sequencial) number and tree is a list of suffix labels of
  the leaves of the tree; each label is a word, they are separated by spaces;
  labels are in reverse lex order.
  TODO: a better reading format is
  # num [
         label
         label
         label
        ]
       maybe it is good to have a converter for this form (one line perl program)
  Depends: file, depth

qtree
  Same list as the corresponding champ file.  Each tree is a single line \Tree
  command for qtree, followed by a line with \newpage.
  Depends: file, depth

prob
  Transition probabilities computed from the initial sample.
  Each line has th form:
    w - a:x b:y ...
  where 
    w is a word of legth <= depth, found in the sample
    the separator - is vertically aligned
    each pair like a:x means:
       a is one alphabet symbol
       x = p(wa|w)
  Depends: file, depth

bst
  Main bootstrapping results.
  Lines starting with # are comments.
  Follows by lines in 3 columns, in blocks separated by two blank lines.
  Each block corresponds to a champ tree, in the same order as before.
  Each line corresponds to a resample size.  For a given size and tree t,
  the corresponding first column entry is an estimate of
   log-likelihood(t, size) - log-likelihood(t', size)
  where t' is the next tree, and the estimator is the average of the
  computed values over the resamples of that size; in the same line column 2
  there appears the standard deviatiation computed alongside the average.
  The third column contains the difference between the corresponding first
  column and the same column shifted one row down; the first entry in the
  column is alwais a ? , meaning "undefined".

  Depends: file, depth, number of resamples, number of sizes, seed, renewal string
 
reg
  Lines starting with # are comments.
  One line for each champ three of the form
   num coef
  where num is the number of the tree,
  coef is the leasts squares linear regression coefficient for the
  same tree's third column in the corresponding bst file.
