The directory named DATA contains the samples with the articles from the newspapers randomly selected from Folha de Sao Paulo and O Publico. Each article appears in two versions, one as a Portuguese text indicated by the extension txt and an encoded version with extension .bin. A Readme file describing the data sources as well as the linguistic pre-processing and encoding procedure is included in this directory.

The directory named SCRIPTS contains
 
1- the perl script silaba2008.pl used to encode the data, 

2- the perl script G4L.pl which performs the SMC procedure. I

3- the perl script simulation.pl which generated the simulated data and performed the SMC procedure appearing in the simulation study.

4- 3 Readme files explaining how to use the perl scripts. 

To make the reader life simpler we also included in this directory the files folha.txt and publico.txt obtained by concatenating the encoded texts from  Folha de Sao Paulo and O Publico respectively appearing in the sample we analyzed.
