Some possible optimizations, most of them irrelevant now, but who knows what
happens with large alphabets:

1) Remove tail recursion in several routines.

2) Eliminate most recursions by first computing a bfs numbering of nodes.

3) In the successive calls of delta_tau, L_tau_mat is called twice for each
   tree.  A little caching would save this replication.

4) Eliminate many calls to get_create_child_node and get_child_node by first
   hashing labels.  Not sure this will be fast.
